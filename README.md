NASA's NEO (Near-Earth Objects) dataset contains 338,199 records of space objects observed from 1910 to 2024. It includes classifications for objects that pose a potential threat to Earth, labeled as 'is_hazardous.' This project aims to accurately predict the 'is_hazardous' status to better prepare for potential asteroid impacts.
